# @mossop/config

This is an attempt to put common parts of my JavaScript project configuration
into a shared location. Other than `base` each directory is a different
configuration set:

* `node-ts`: Modules that use TypeScript in a node environment.
* `vscode-ts`: VS Code extensions written in TypeScript.
* `web-ts`: Web apps written in TypeScript.
* `react-ts`: React apps written in TypeScript.
* `react-native-ts`: React Native apps written in TypeScript.
